Project created as an assignment for the class SWENG 311 Object-Oriented Design during the Fall 2024 semester.

# Text Analyzer
This Java Text Analyzer uses a producer-consumer pattern to break a text into individual words while tallying all the word frequencies to display the most frequent word in the text to the user.

## What I learned
- To create multiple threads in a program and divide tasks between them.
- To use linked lists as a buffer between producer and consumer threads, understanding how threads communicate.
